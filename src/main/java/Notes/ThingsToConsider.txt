Things to consider:

Reconsider passives. Perhaps they could function like aoe abilities,
where they use a tag to check if it's a passive, and thus should be excluded
from ability choices in combat, rather than being separated into its own thing.
On the other hand, it does make for somewhat nicer organization to have passives
separated into their own category.
